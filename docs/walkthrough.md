# Architecture & Security Remediation

## Overview

We have successfully restructured the project into a Monorepo, configured the Prisma MCP Server, and remediated critical security vulnerabilities in both Beta and Production environments.

## Achievements

### 1. Architecture Refactoring

- **Monorepo Structure**: Codebase organized into `apps/web` (Frontend) and `packages/core` (Business Logic).
- **Build Success**: Verified `npm run build` for `apps/web`.

### 2. MCP Configuration (Prisma)

- **Prisma 7 Upgrade**: Updated Prisma to v7 to support modern configuration.
- **Config Migration**: Converted `schema.prisma` configuration to `prisma.config.js`.
- **Connectivity**: Verified `prisma-mcp-server` connection to the Beta database.

### 3. Security Remediation (Critical)

- **Schema Recovery**: Reconstructed missing database tables (`transactions`, `accounts`) from TypeScript entity definitions.
- **Beta Fix**: Applied RLS policies to `audit-tool-beta`.
- **Production Fix**: Pushed schema and applied RLS policies to `audit-tool-prod` (which was previously empty).
- **Verification**: Validated table existance and RLS status using `scripts/verify_db_state.js`.

### 4. GitHub Integration

- **Branch**: Created `moredev` branch with all changes.
- **Pull Request**: Opened **PR #2** (`feat: architecture restructuring & security fixes`) against `develop`.
- **CI/CD**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run tests/builds **ONLY** on PRs targeting `develop` or `beta`.
- **Release**: Created **PR #4** (`moredev` -> `beta`) to promote changes to the staging environment.
- **Pre-commit**: Configured `husky` to block commits with secrets, `.env` files, or high-severity vulnerabilities (`npm audit`).

## Documentation

- **Development Workflow**: Created `docs/development-workflow.md` detailing CI/CD pipeline, security checks, and manual commands.
- **Security Policy**: Updated `SECURITY.md` to reflect the new Architecture and Reporting process.
- **Contributing**: Rewrote `CONTRIBUTING.md` to align with the Monorepo structure and Gitflow.
- **Readme**: Updated `README.md` with correct links and CI triggers.

## Deployment Strategy (Vercel)

| Environment        | Branch    | Vercel Project    | Deploy Type      |
| :----------------- | :-------- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| **Development**    | `develop` | `audit-tool-dev`  | Auto (Merge)     |
| **Beta (Staging)** | `beta`    | `audit-tool-beta` | Auto (Hotfix)    |
| **Production**     | `main`    | `audit-tool-prod` | Manual (Promote) |

## Verification Results (Latest)

- **White Screen Fix**: Vercel deployment `dpl_fpaHL8t6E5ib5KbmMgu2avs35HUQ` is `READY`. The alias `audit-tool-hazel.vercel.app` is pointing to this deployment (`develop` branch).
- **Chunk Size**: `CashFlow` chunk reduced to **18.19 kB** (gzip: 5.36 kB).
  - `ui` chunk: 385.35 kB (recharts, lucide)
  - `vendor` chunk: 401.76 kB (react, supabase, etc)
- **Security**: `npm audit` shows no High/Critical vulnerabilities. `tar` was overridden to `^7.5.9`.
- **Pre-commit**: All hooks passed, including security checks.

## Usage

### Run Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Verify Database State

```bash
# Beta
node scripts/verify_db_state.js

# Production
$env:DATABASE_URL='<PROD_URL>'; node scripts/verify_db_state.js
```

### Apply Migrations to Future Envs

```bash
# 1. Push Schema
npx prisma db push

# 2. Apply Security Policies
node prisma/seed.js
```
