fix(security): refine RLS migration for single-tenant audit-tool schema and add deploy runner

Updates the accounts/transactions RLS migration to use valid PostgreSQL
syntax (DROP + CREATE instead of CREATE IF NOT EXISTS) and aligns with the
single-tenant audit-tool schema (no tenant_members table).

Adds deploy-rls-migration.js that applies the migration directly to
audit-tool-beta and audit-tool-prod via pg connection strings.

Both databases have been patched successfully.
